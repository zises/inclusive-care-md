        content:
          - Depending on medical history, many patients receive their signed physician certification after their very first visit.
          - We charge $300 for patients who receive a medical certification, regardless of how many visits are required before the certification is signed.
        important: If you do not qualify you will not be charged.

    subheader:
#     - You asked 
    blocks:
      - question: What other requirements are there to get a card?
        answer: You must be able to demonstrate that you are an Illinois resident, with either a driver&#x27;s license or official mail in your name sent to an Illinois address.
      - question: Do you accept insurance?
        answer: No. All expenses are out-of-pocket.
      - question: How old do I have to be?
        answer: There is no age minimum. Minors will need parental consent and will also require a second doctor&#x27;s certification, which will require an additional doctor&#x27;s visit and cost an additional $100.
      - question: What if I&#x27;m not sure that I qualify?
        answer: Fill out the form with the information you have and let&#x27;s figure it out together. Many more people qualify than believe they do and, with a free initial consultation, there&#x27;s no risk to you in trying.
      - question: How long does it take to get a card?
        answer: Before recent changes to the law, it was taking about 3 months after the application was submitted. However, now that background checks have ended we expect this number to drop very quickly.

          Dr Consalter and Katie were extremely helpful and compassionate.
          It would have been impossible for me to navigate the system without them.
          I could not be happier. They get my highest praise and most enthusiastic recommendation.

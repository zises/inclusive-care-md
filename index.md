      - header: 3. Certification
        content:
          - Depending on medical history, many patients receive their signed physician certification after their very first visit.
          - We charge $300 for patients who receive a medical certification, regardless of how many visits are required before the certification is signed.
        important: If you do not qualify you will not be charged.

    header: Frequently Asked Questions
    subheader:
#     - You asked 
    blocks:
      - question: What other requirements are there to get a card?
        answer: You must be able to demonstrate that you are an Illinois resident, with either a driver&#x27;s license or official mail in your name sent to an Illinois address.
      - question: Do you accept insurance?
        answer: No. All expenses are out-of-pocket.
      - question: How old do I have to be?
        answer: There is no age minimum. Minors will need parental consent and will also require a second doctor&#x27;s certification, which will require an additional doctor&#x27;s visit and cost an additional $100.
      - question: What if I&#x27;m not sure that I qualify?
        answer: Fill out the form with the information you have and let&#x27;s figure it out together. Many more people qualify than believe they do and, with a free initial consultation, there&#x27;s no risk to you in trying.
      - question: How long does it take to get a card?
        answer: Before recent changes to the law, it was taking about 3 months after the application was submitted. However, now that background checks have ended we expect this number to drop very quickly.
